### Welcome

Hey there! Thanks for stopping by. As a native to upstate New York, I have had just about enough of winter. So recently, I moved halfway across the globe to Geelong, Australia to pursue a PhD in bioinformatics. Here, I spend a lot of time learning about the application of data science to medical genomics. To this end, I am motivated by the prospect that we may someday soon harness genomic data to revolutionize medical prognostics, diagnostics, and therapeutics. I like thinking about the theory and practice of how scientists define disease constructs and then separate diseased from healthy. My other key interests include machine learning, knowledge integration, vegan cooking, traditional photography, and the DIY ethic. I write R packages for [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and blog for [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/).
