### Welcome

Hey there! Thanks for stopping by. I'm a native to upstate New York who moved halfway across the globe to Geelong, Australia to study bioinformatics. Here, I spend a lot of time applying data science to medical genomics. I am motivated by the possibility that we may someday soon harness genomic data to improve medical prognostics, diagnostics, and therapeutics. My other key interests include machine learning, study design, nosology, vegan cooking, and traditional photography. I also write poetry.
