### An Old Erie Reminder

remember that day, you and I<br>
restlessly still, unpacked<br>
with a case of fooled ambition<br>
the brochure plans still intact<br>

spent, the whole weak, hauling cargo:<br>
imported craft from the Old World<br>
piled neat, in over our heads<br>
excised by customs, taxed and tolled<br>

when we said, "Enough is enough."<br>
drove a circle around city square<br>
left our belonging for the free-way<br>
and set out for not here nor there<br>

but for a trek East along the river<br>
where the NO-TRESPASS sign-posts roam<br>
(we go where we want to go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth is OUR home)<br>

beyond the broken city limits<br>
and the post-industrial decline<br>
we touched on a more tender landscape<br>
fastened beneath the rust-belt line<br>

where by the pink and purple sky<br>
etched forever in my mind<br>
we atoned for our flawed conception<br>
and embraced in mortal design<br>

<br>
