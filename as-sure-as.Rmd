### As Sure As

as sure as<br>
the sky parts blue when pinched,<br>
and a thousand critters squirm beneath,<br>
and the trees, they dance<br>
in a breezy trance,<br>
I see:<br>

how the petals, without fault<br>
will flourish, then moult<br>
and offer their peace<br>
to greener sheets<br>

and if:<br>
you forget<br>
how people quibble and jib<br>
then finally you can<br>
freely<br>
live<br>

<br>
