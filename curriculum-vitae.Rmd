### Professional skills

##### **R/Bioconductor**

###### Fluency in the R scripting language with experience using several Bioconductor packages. Some bioinformatic programming projects include the development of tools for predicting transcription factor binding motif disruptions by disorder-associated SNPs, mapping molecular interactions using multiple databases, and implementing high-throughput supervised machine learning with sample bootstrapping.

##### **Bioinformatics**

###### Familiarity using public data repositories including dbGAP, NCBI GEO, BioMart, and UCSC Genome Browser. Extensive time devoted to applying supervised machine learning in the classification of patients based on gene expression data, including the exploration of novel feature selection methods. Familiarity with clustering algorithms including hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering. Experience visualizing high-dimensional data through dimension reduction with methods such as principal components analysis.

### Professional experience

#### In industry,

##### **Adveq Management:** April 2016 to present

###### Worked to develop an object-oriented back-end in R for organizing, modeling, and analyzing transactions between financial institutions. Position held as a short-term, free-lance contract.

#### In research,

##### **SUNY Upstate Medical University:** August 2012 to May 2016

###### Worked in a psychiatric genetics lab under Dr. Stephen Glatt to study the molecular underpinnings of psychiatric disorders. Efforts largely included the development of bioinformatic tools for the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms and microarray-based gene expression data. Extensive time devoted to the implementation machine learning for the classification of autism spectrum disorder using genomic data.

##### **SUNY New Paltz:** September 2009 to August 2010

##### **SUNY Purchase:** May 2009 to July 2009

###### Worked in an environmental science lab under oceanographer Dr. Kristopher Baker to study the impact of anthropogenic input on the biodiversity of the Hudson River estuary. Investigation presented as lecture.

#### In education,

##### **Coursera:** September 2016 to October 2016

###### Employed as a graduate assistant to Dr. Isabelle Bichindaritz for an online course in bioinformatics titled "Big Data, Genes, and Medicine".

##### **SUNY New Paltz:** September 2009 to May 2011

###### Employed as a teaching assistant for an undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory class. Periodically employed as a tutor to undergraduate students in the subjects of mathematics, biology, and chemistry.

##### **SUNY Orange:** September 2008 to August 2009

###### Employed in a math learning center to assist students in need of help in college mathematics courses. Periodically employed as a tutor to undergraduate students in the subjects of mathematics, biology, and chemistry.
