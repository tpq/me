### Open source software

#### R packages which I designed and maintain,

##### **balance** | [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=balance)

###### Balances have become a cornerstone of compositional data analysis. However, conceptualizing balances is difficult, especially for high-dimensional data. Most often, investigators visualize balances with "balance dendrograms". However, this visualization tool does not scale well for large data. This package provides an alternative scheme for visualizing balances, described in [Quinn (2018)]. This package also provides a method for principal balance analysis.

##### **exprso** | [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=exprso)

###### Supervised machine learning has an increasingly important role in data analysis. This package introduces a framework for rapidly building and deploying supervised machine learning in a high-throughput manner. This package provides a user-friendly interface that empowers investigators to execute state-of-the-art binary and multi-class classification, as well as regression, with minimal programming experience necessary.

##### **peakRAM** | [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=peakRAM)

###### When working with big data sets, RAM conservation is critically important. However, it is not always enough to just monitor the size of the objects created. So-called "copy-on-modify" behavior, characteristic of R, means that some expressions or functions may require an unexpectedly large amount of RAM overhead. For example, replacing a single value in a matrix duplicates that matrix in the back-end, making this task require twice as much RAM as that used by the matrix itself. This package makes it easy to monitor the total and peak RAM used so that developers can quickly identify and eliminate RAM hungry code.

##### **propr** | [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=propr)

###### The bioinformatic evaluation of gene co-expression often begins with correlation-based analyses. However, correlation lacks validity when applied to relative data, including count data generated by next-generation sequencing. This package implements several metrics for proportionality, including phi [Lovell et al (2015)] and rho [Erb and Notredame (2016)]. This package also implements several metrics for differential proportionality. Unlike correlation, these measures give the same result for both relative and absolute data.

#### R packages to which I contributed,

##### **ALDEx2** | [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/ALDEx2.html)

###### This package performs a differential abundance analysis of biological count data using log-ratio transformations.

##### **catmap** | [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=catmap)

###### This package conducts a meta-analysis on combined case-control and family-based (TDT) genetic data.
