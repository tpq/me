### For Alexander

Alexander,<br>

your all is vile<br>
even the shadow curses your name<br>
as you siphon off the living<br>
into an early grave<br>

you are cruder than the oil<br>
earth holds like ash in urn<br>
made in a fever feeding frenzy<br>
of tandem stomach churns<br>

no one will write you an enneagram<br>
to match your crooked face<br>
they will bag you twice in caustic bleach<br>
and burn you with the hazard waste<br>

and<br>
no one will mourn you<br>

and<br>
no one will cry<br>

and<br>
no one will miss you<br>

but I<br>

<br>
