### Immolation Arch

at daybreak<br>
the future shines chrome yellow<br>
like the enamel of a schoolbus<br>
full of teenage anarchists who swear:<br>
they will get it right<br>

but a life of time passes<br>
without pry or notice<br>
as the cities fill to fulfill<br>
their invented purpose<br>

and the world the same,<br>
having glowed before<br>
and met with solemn vows<br>
starts to bore<br>

for dawn is a bride draped in an ochre veil<br>
whose luscious hues soon go pale<br>

and the yellow stuff<br>
that paints the mountains<br>
that paints the trees<br>
that paints the sea<br>

that made fervors yearn<br>
like fever burns<br>
the earth, it turns<br>
skin red<br>

with the prickled sense<br>
of a color wheal:<br>

it reminds us,<br>
the brilliant are responsible<br>
for all undoing<br>

<br>
