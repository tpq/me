### In My Inkblot Notebook

in my inkblot notebook<br>
I can see you just as I am,<br>
kept by you as your own<br>

imagined filigree,<br>
some number of pages deep beneath<br>
a foreign greeting:<br>

how long will we remember<br>
how we could not bare to see<br>
the rising rust redact our<br>
desperate attempts at<br>
alchemy?<br>

a reign of gilded silence lost<br>
to a hum of railroad steal<br>

but had I drawn you<br>
out from the paper,<br>
I could know Even for a moment<br>
that ephemeral conviction<br>
of purpose<br>

an instant of communion<br>
in otherwise<br>
parallel<br>
lives<br>

<br>
