### Welcome

Hey there! Thanks for stopping by. My name is Thom Quinn and I am a career student in medicine (and life). Currently, I live in Geelong, Australia where I am pursuinig a PhD at Deakin University focused on the application of data science to medical genomics. I am motivated by the prospect that we may someday soon harness genomic data to revolutionize medical prognostics, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Lately, I am intrigued by the theory and practice behind how scientists define disease constructs and then differentiate diseased cases from controls. Other key interests include machine learning and knowledge integration. Adherent to the DIY ethic and friend to the open source collective.
