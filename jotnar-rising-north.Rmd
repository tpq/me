### Jotnar Rising North

so i made it here<br>
to the promised land<br>
the long sought prize<br>
now in my hand<br>

the two cats and yard<br>
from the first refrain<br>
out my window sill<br>
like a picture frame<br>

and the wood floor plans<br>
we sketched all spring<br>
i followed through<br>
on everything<br>

from the ceiling cracks<br>
to the baseboard trim<br>
i crossed every inch<br>
cleansed every sin<br>

and what remains<br>
the immaculate<br>
is this the face<br>
of providence?<br>

i am scratched off clean<br>
new coat of eggshell white<br>
but i am incomplete<br>
i am a prototype<br>

<br>
