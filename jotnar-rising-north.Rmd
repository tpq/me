### Jotnar Rising North

so we made it here<br>
to the Promised Land<br>
the long sought prize<br>
now in our hands<br>

the two cats and yard<br>
from the first refrain<br>
out our window still<br>
like a picture frame<br>

the wood floor plans<br>
we sketched all spring<br>
I followed through<br>
on everything<br>

from the ceiling cracks<br>
to the baseboard trim<br>
I crossed every inch<br>
cleansed every sin<br>

and what remains<br>
the immaculate<br>
is this the face<br>
of providence?<br>

I am scratched off clean<br>
new coat of eggshell white<br>
but I am still not whole<br>
I am a prototype<br>

<br>
