### Rinse and Retreat

sorrow doesn't knock<br>
she just lets herself in<br>
and throws down her bags<br>
on the guest room bed<br>
and then picks and unpacks<br>
like a tandem parade<br>
placing knick-knacks, high<br>
on handsome display<br>

then she sits at the kitchen<br>
and asks to be fed<br>
and not if you had<br>
other plans instead<br>
and she mandates attention<br>
all evening long<br>
but snubs when you mention<br>
you work at dawn<br>

like a mother she hints<br>
with laughter at flaws<br>
as she points out the dints<br>
in the rafters and walls<br>
and she finds every fault<br>
from highest to low<br>
and says,<br>
"boy have you really<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;let yourself go"<br>

but it's just my cyclical fate<br>
to slip through fickle states<br>
sometimes the goodness stays<br>
sometimes I sleep for days<br>

when I awake, she's gone,<br>
without a note<br>

though she always leaves,<br>
what if one day<br>
she won't?<br>

<br>
