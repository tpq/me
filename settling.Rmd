### Settling

I am in the quiet room
on the north west hall's end
while in the room beside me
chemotherapy drips

I am not here because I want quiet
rather, new hospital policy forbids the consumption
of coffee by the nurse station
and I am not, well
nevermind.

I am quiet at least, for now
I listen to the skyline of a city
not regarded for its skyline,
not regarded at all

and I read Wallace Stevens
and I form opinions
