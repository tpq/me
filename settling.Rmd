### Settling

I am in the quiet room<br>
on the north west hall's end<br>
while in the room beside me<br>
chemotherapy drips<br>

I am not here because I want quiet<br>
rather, new hospital policy forbids the consumption<br>
of coffee by the nurse station<br>
and I am not, well<br>
nevermind.<br>

I am quiet at least, for now<br>
I listen to the skyline of a city<br>
not regarded for its skyline,<br>
not regarded at all<br>

and I read Wallace Stevens<br>
and I form opinions<br>

<br>
