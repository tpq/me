### Tinged

criterion[] criterion[] criterion.][<br>
GOD among us, as Hyperion<br>
throned above the high echelon<br>
of "so pray tell me<br>
who are you?"<br>

forever tangled in perimeter blue? or<br>
an off-white pixel in shadow hue? or<br>
a spectrum Man trapped in a prism cell? or<br>
a portrait pieced into a rubric cube?<br>

there is science and agenda<br>
for all cyans and magentas<br>

but in the end,<br>
please:<br>

don't include me in your elevator scheme<br>
I'd rather stand my ground and florid dream<br>

on the cliffs of Minnewaska,<br>
or some forgotten migrant trail<br>
or on the towpaths along foothills<br>
that once passed ships by sail<br>

and I will eat my plums in the garden<br>
and beat my drums in the far den<br>

and if this isn't normal<br>
then who?<br>

<br>
