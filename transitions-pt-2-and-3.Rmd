### Transitions Pt. 2 & 3

that Doodlebug,<br>
hired help to navigate the northern hills<br>
for its hidden ore<br>
and gemstones<br>

could uncover only graves<br>
with artifacts none would ever adorn<br>
rather, it was our bark and hazel leaf<br>

eyes that uncovered the jewel<br>
beneath the rough, beneath the greenery<br>
still, the few almonds we bartered<br>

paid in full<br>
for the hackneyed charisma that<br>
only a Doodlebug<br>
can offer<br>

so soon then we found ourselves<br>
in the crosshairs of crossroads, and<br>
in the grip of a foreign land<br>

but who could worry now<br>
under Hyperion's providence? and<br>
who could trouble when<br>
we followed East<br>

His Sun, toward Mecca,<br>
where its divine offerings<br>
absolved us of all<br>
our doubt<br>

<br>
