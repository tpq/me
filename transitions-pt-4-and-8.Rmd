### Transitions Pt. 4 & 8

I could not tell you:<br>
the smell, or<br>
the place, or<br>
the color<br>

and more often I forget:<br>
the carvings in the bark,<br>
the stains in the sod,<br>
the pits in the earth<br>

but I remember the feeling<br>
of finally finding Home<br>

and we may not be trees<br>
but for now (if you'd please)<br>
we can welcome in sunlight<br>
through our bare canopies<br>

and enjoy our showers<br>
from beneath sprinklers<br>
and extend our roots<br>
through new ground<br>

so that we may Grow<br>

<br>
