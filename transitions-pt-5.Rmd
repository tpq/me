### Transitions Pt. 5

as we scrape our knives<br>
over this course, course canvas<br>
in an attempt to salvage<br>

we try<br>
we try our best<br>
to decipher the Braille<br>
written on<br>
the walls<br>

as if understanding<br>
the Author's intent<br>
could make the pain<br>
in our wrists<br>
subside<br>
