### Travel by Inner-state

tuned in now to West Virginia<br>
just ten miles left in Pennsylvania<br>
and a past of passed towns unearthed<br>
where the stories of men go unheard<br>

but I can hear them now<br>
from the FM band on the southern bound<br>
the receiver rings, the soul sings through<br>
from the nameless source, alive and true<br>

and i feel so small<br>
trying to count what matters in this world<br>

and i feel so bored<br>
listening to the post-modern drawl<br>

and i feel so dumb<br>
trying to collect my thoughts as they come<br>

but i will overcome<br>
this listless nihilist doldrum<br>

<br>
