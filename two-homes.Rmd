### Two Homes

you're not from a place<br>
until you leave the place<br>
only then does it become true<br>
when the familiar scenes<br>
you've loved and known<br>
you find others<br>
never knew<br>

you're not from a place<br>
until you leave the place<br>
only then does it become real<br>
when the quiet bench<br>
in the secret spot<br>
is no longer yours<br>
to feel<br>

you're not from a place<br>
until you leave the place<br>
only then does it become clear<br>
that the memory<br>
of trifles had<br>
turned into something<br>
you hold dear<br>

you're not from a place<br>
until you leave the place<br>
this, I learned too late<br>
because once you're from<br>
a second place<br>
there's no refuge<br>
you can take<br>

<br>
