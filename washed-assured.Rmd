### Washed Assured

is the sea not mad?<br>
or has summer boiled us whole?<br>
the breeze has dripped salt on my lips<br>
and I have turned wild<br>

your salt on my lips<br>
will you take me to the cedar grove?<br>

I was a prisoner in the garden<br>
milking black honey from shoots<br>
planting my two-lips along dry basins<br>
and longing for tuberous truths<br>

but then you, mud angel<br>
trespassing on another's dream<br>
slipped your way into my Eden<br>
and washed my fate clean<br>

and at once my life remembered<br>
the cyclic splash of bleak Decembers<br>
had suddenly seemed stranger<br>
than the present tense<br>

as your grace as great as prophet<br>
unto my impostor self imparted<br>
a planar truth no more contorted<br>
then, this present sense<br>

and sorrow's held no solace since<br>

<br>
