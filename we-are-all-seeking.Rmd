### We Are All Seeking

we are all seeking<br>
redemption from<br>
the finite<br>

some gesture<br>
or proclamation<br>
that might<br>
make us<br>
DIVINE<br>

but,<br>
out of some infinite permutations<br>
of nothing<br>

you were<br>
born<br>

into an existence which defies<br>
belief<br>

just Be<br>
relevant<br>
to your<br>
self<br>

<br>
